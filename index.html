		<h3 class="title text-center col-xs-12 col-sm-12">About <span class="title red">TEDxYouth@CIS</span></h3>
			<p class="intro col-xs-12 col-sm-12">In spirit of ideas worth spreading, TED has created TEDx. TEDx is a programme of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience.</p>
			<p class="intro col-xs-12 col-sm-12">Chinese International School’s event is called TEDxYouth@CIS, where x = independently organized TED event.</p>
			<p class="intro col-xs-12 col-sm-12">At TEDxYouth@CIS, live speakers, TEDTalks videos, and live performances will combine to spark deep discussion and connection within the community. This annual student-orchestrated event aims to create a friendly platform where all members of the entire CIS community can share experiences, shed light on ideas, and deliver personal messages. Ultimately, we envisage that it will give our community the opportunity to stimulate dialogue through TED-like experiences in an intimate setting.</p>
			<p class="intro col-xs-12 col-sm-12">Special thanks to CISPTA and the Annual Fund for their generous support.</p>

		<h3 class="title text-center col-xs-12 col-sm-12">About <span class="title red">TED</span></h3>
			<p class="intro col-xs-12 col-sm-12">TED is a nonprofit organization devoted to Ideas Worth Spreading. Started as a four-day conference in California 27 years ago, TED has grown to support those world-changing ideas with multiple initiatives. At TED, the world’s leading thinkers and doers are asked to give the talk of their lives in 18 minutes. Talks are then made available, free, at TED.com. TED speakers have included Bill Gates, Jane Goodall, Elizabeth Gilbert, Sir Richard Branson, Benoit Mandelbrot, Philippe Starck, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Isabel Allende and former UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown. Two major TED events are held each year: The TED Conference takes place every spring in Long Beach, California (along with a parallel conference, TEDActive, in Palm Springs), and TEDGlobal is held each summer in Edinburgh, Scotland.</p>
			<p class="intro col-xs-12 col-sm-12">TED’s media initiatives include TED.com, where new TEDTalks are posted daily; the new TED Conversations, enabling broad conversations among TED fans; and the Open Translation Project, which provides subtitles and interactive transcripts as well as the ability for any TEDTalk to be translated by volunteers worldwide.</p>
			<p class="intro col-xs-12 col-sm-12">TED has established the annual TED Prize, where exceptional individuals with a wish to change the world are given the opportunity to put their wishes into action; TEDx, which offers individuals or groups a way to host local, self-organized events around the world; and the TED Fellows program, helping world-changing innovators from around the globe to become part of the TED community and, with its help, amplify the impact of their remarkable projects and activities.</p>

				<div class="col-xs-7 col-sm-7"><p class="bios">My name is Catherine Wang. For the past four years, I have had two main obsessions: studying the applications of computer science, and attempting, rather tortuously, to write poetry. After reading the works of Isaac Asimov, I became fascinated with the immense theoretical possibilities of artificial intelligence. There, in the liminal space between science and art, my two obsessions merged. In this year's TEDx, I will be exploring the capacity for language in artificial intelligence systems. In terms of creating realistic, conversational machine programs capable of communicating with humans, where were we, where are we now, and where are we heading?</p></div>

In my speech, I will be talking about creative writing, with a focus on poetry. In the process of doing so, I hope to dispel some unfortunate stereotypes surrounding creative writing, capture how creativity can be found in the everyday, and commit, E.E. Cummings-style, a lot of literary sin taxes.</p></div>

She was subjected to different types of harassment and bullying, which made her feel 'wrong' and disconnected. However, through this experience, she managed to build her own unique identity and through her talk, she would like to invite you to see the beauty of being different.</p></div>

I spend a lot of my time wandering and pondering. I’m going to be speaking to you about something very special. More specifically, about having a happy place, what it is, where it is, how to develop your own and why it is important. I hope you enjoy the event, it is going to be fantastic!</p></div>

Whilst this was a trip down memory lane for some, it was a foreign yet extraordinary travel back into the 30s for me.
